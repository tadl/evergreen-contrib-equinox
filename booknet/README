The booknet_exporter.pl script is used to produce CSV output
of holds and circulation data for BookNet Canada and send the 
output via FTP.  Using this script requires the FTP credentials 
for the server being transferred to and database access 
credentials for your Evergreen system.  The script is written 
in Perl and relies on several libraries listed in the script.  

The script will create three files in this format:

BRANCHDATA_foo_04092018.csv
LENDINGDATA_foo_04092018.csv
foo_export_log

where 'foo' is the Evergreen org unit identified for export.
After generating the files it will transfer them to the FTP
server supplied if those parameters have been supplied.

Parameters are as follows:

  --org         This is the short name of an org unit.  The export 
                will create holdings and lending files for any branch 
                or branches listed and their descendants as long as 
                the org unit is allowed to own volumes.

                If invoking once for all org units simply supply 
                the consortial shortname, e.g.

                --org CONS

                If invoking for multiple systems distinctly list each
                separated by a comma inside double quotes, e.g.

                --org "SystemA,SystemB,SystemD"


  --db_host      - required with failover*
  --db_user      - required with failover*
  --db_database  - required with failover*
  --db_password  - required with failover*
  --db_port      - optional, defaults to 5432

  *Database failover behavior: if the required database parameters are 
  not sent it will attempt to use a local socket connection.

  --ftp_folder   - optional
  --ftp_host     - required with failover**
  --ftp_user     - required even if 'anonymous with failover**'
  --ftp_password - optional
  --ftp_port     - optional, defaults to 21 

  **FTP failover behavior: if there is no host and user it will generate the 
  file but not attempt to transfer it.  i

A typical weekly cron entry will look like this:

30 0 * * 1 . ~/.bashrc && cd /home/opensrf/scripts/booknet/ && ./booknet_exporter.pl \ 
    --db_host foo-db --db_user foo --db_database foo --db_password foo  
    --org FOO --ftp_host ftp.foo.foo --ftp_password foo --ftp_user foo

Since the script reports the date that the report is run it should be run on the 
last day of the reporting period.  I.e. if you are collecting data for Monday - 
Sunday then run the script after the close of business on Sunday night to have the 
correct date.
