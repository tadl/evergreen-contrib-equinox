above_treeline_export.pl - for daily exports
above_treeline_historical_export.pl - for historical exports at setup, 
    doesn't take the run_date parameter but ohterwise the same

Creates CSV files as specified in the Edelweiss Analytics for Libraries 
onboarding documentation.  

The following files are created: 

Item - collects asset and circulation data for all time, previous month and year. 
    All holdings are pulled from descendants of the org defined in the 
    --org parameter unless the item is deleted or the copy or copy location
    is set to non-circulating.  The file is generated with a datestamp for the 
    day it is run on, e.g.  Item_20180220.csv was generated on Feb 20th, 2018. 

Circ - collects daily transaction data for the previous day of when 
    the file is run by default but will use the date flag to give historical 
    data as well

Hold - collects holds based on materials owned by an included org unit 
    and holds with a pickup library of an included org.  This has no 
    impact when the entire system is being exported but when a subset 
    of orgs in a consortium with resource sharing are exported some 
    holds will not export.  This will use the date flag to give you a data set 
    of how holds were unfilled on that date.

Order - this gives acquisitions order data based on the ordering library 
    and does not honor the date flag, giving current data for orders as they exist 
    when the script is run

Bibs - this can be the slowest of the files to generate and it's speed will vary 
    widely based on the database size and if it's run the first time or as a followup;
    all other files capture that frame of time for statistics but due to having to 
    read individual MARC records the script will first generate a comprehensive table 
    and then only update in subsequent runs for bibs that have since been edited, 
    it does not honor the date flag

Typical cron entries will include a weekly update of bibs and items and daily updates 
of the other files, e.g.:  

above_treeline_export.pl --db_host foo.org --db_user foo --db_database everfoo \
    --db_password passfoo --org CONS --files hold,order,circ \
    --ftp_host ftp.abovethetreeline.com --ftp_user user --ftp_password password

above_treeline_export.pl --db_host foo.org --db_user foo --db_database everfoo 
    --db_password passfoo --org CONS --files hold,order,circ \
    --ftp_host ftp.abovethetreeline.com --ftp_user user --ftp_password password

Switches:

  --files       optional, if not defined all will be created
                accepts item|circ|hold|bib|order
                more than one may be specified by using commas 
                e.g.  --files circ,bib

  --run_date    optional, used for generating files as if the script was 
                being run on a previous date, if not supplied it defaults to
                today, note that transactions run for the previous day 
                so if you want transactions for 2018-02-19 supply the date
                it would run as as the 20th, e.g. --run_date 20180220 

  --db_host      - required with failover 
  --db_user      - required with failover
  --db_database  - required with failover
  --db_password  - required with failover
  --db_port      - optional, defaults to 5432

  Database failover behavior: if the required database parameters are 
  not sent it will attempt to use a local socket connection.

  --ftp_folder   - optional
  --ftp_host     - required with failover
  --ftp_user     - required with failover
  --ftp_password - optional
  --ftp_port     - optional, defaults to 21

  FTP failover behavior: if there is no host and user it will generate the 
  file but not attempt to transfer it.  User is required even if it is set 
  to anonymous.
