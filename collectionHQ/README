The scripts in this directory are used to produce
a periodic report in text format of bibs and holdings
in an Evergreen database for submission to collectionHQ.

Installation and usage:

[1] Run functions.sql in your (reporting) Evergreen database
    to create the collectionHQ schema and a couple functions.
[2] Edit extract.sh, get_bibs.sql, and get_items.sql to
    put in your library code and FTP credentials with collectionHQ and
    email parameters for the notification email that extract.sh can
    send.
[3] Run extract.sh manually or set up a periodic cronjob, for example:

0 2 20 * * cd /home/esi/collectionHQ && ./extract.sh
